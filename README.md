# SimplePass - tiny password generation

SimplePass is a small command-line password generator with both Ruby and Rust
versions, for comparison and education purposes.

It was written for the article [Password Generation in Ruby and Rust][article].

For a more serious implementation of this kind of tool, see [mkpass][mkpass],
which is more fully-featured and includes a selection of dedicated password
wordlists.
